  <h1>History</h1>
  <p>I didn’t begin adulthood thinking I would be a journalist, so in my ways this career is very much improbable. I grew up wanting to be a scientist, to find cures to the most debilitating diseases in the world and have that be the mark I leave on the world.
Life had other plans instead. After several failed attempts at a career, I decided I would work toward a profession I was passionate about, and the more I thought about the future I wanted, the more journalism came into focus.</p>

<p>I started my path to becoming a reporter in the only way that I knew how — by going to school. I enrolled in an introductory journalism class at the local community college, along with volunteering for the campus paper. By the end of the term, I had composed several articles, including a long-form enterprise story about the value of a college degree.</p>

For the first time, I felt as if I had a purpose in life—and the rest is history. One year, that was all it took, and before I knew it, I was packing my belongings to begin my first professional journalism job at a weekly newspaper in New Mexico.
From there I was off to a daily publication in Nebraska covering education before making another move to Wisconsin to write about government and politics as a city and county reporter.
I am completely in love with this profession. I would not have it any other way.</p>
